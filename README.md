# Webscraping-news-volatility-email

This repository was created with the intention of extracting data from an economic calendar from the investing.com site, getting the main news from the site (three-star level) and sending it by e-mail.

So for example, we took this information from the website:

And this is the result by email, the same as the site with three stars level of that day

Thank you, that's all for this project, any questions contact me.
